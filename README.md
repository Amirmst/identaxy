For Beta:
Communicating with TACC database
We have been talking to Dr. Schubert and he is getting the people to connect us to the TACC database so we could not use their database for our app yet.

We have made a mock database in the meantime that mocks how we would use the TACC database including retrieving photos from firebase storage, and sending/storing data to the database, as well as updating the database (e.g. creating users, updating passwords, changing passwords.

For Alpha:
There are no differences in what is being submitted vs the proposed alpha design/implementations. We are on track.
